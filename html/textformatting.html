 		<h1>ABOUT ISRO</h1>
 	</center>
 	<hr>
 	<p><em>ISRO</em> was previously The Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR), set up by The Government of India in 1962, as envisioned by scientist <i>Vikram Sarabhai</i>, recognising the need in space research. <b>INCOSPAR</b> grew and became ISRO in 1969, within DAE.[8] In 1972, the government of India set up a <u><b>Space Commission</b></u> and DOS, bringing ISRO under it. <del>The establishment</del> of ISRO thus institutionalised space research activities in India.[9][10] It since then has been managed by DOS, which governs various other institutions in India in the domain of <mark>astronomy</mark> and space technology.
 	<br/>
 	ISRO built India's first satellite, Aryabhata, which was launched by the Soviet space agency Interkosmos in 1975.[12] In 1980, <sub>ISRO launched satellite</sub> RS-1 onboard its own SLV-3, making India the seventh country to be capable of undertaking orbital launches. SLV-3 was followed by ASLV, which was subsequently succeeded by development of many medium-lift launch vehicles, rocket engines, <small>satellite</small> systems and networks enabling the agency to launch hundreds of domestic and foreign satellites and <big>various deep</big> space missions for space <sup>exploration</sup>.
 	<br/>
 	<br/>
 	<strong>Goals</strong> in near future include expanding satellites fleet, landing a rover on Moon, sending humans into space, development of a semi-cryogenic engine, sending more uncrewed missions to the Moon, Mars, Venus and the Sun and deployment of more space <font>telescopes</font> in orbit to observe cosmic phenomena and outerspace beyond the Solar System. Long-term plans include development of reusable launchers, heavy and super heavy launch vehicles, deploying a space station, sending exploration missions to external planets like Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune and asteroids and crewed missions to moons and planets.
